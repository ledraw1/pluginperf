# Real-Time Audio Thread Research

## Goal
Implement DAW-equivalent real-time audio thread priority for accurate plugin performance measurements.

## Final Implementation (October 2025)

```cpp
// In main.cpp - Set once after plugin loading
Process::setPriority(Process::RealtimePriority);

// All measurements run at elevated priority
for (int block : args.buffers) {
    BenchmarkResult result = benchThread.runBenchmark(config);
    // Runs with continuous RT priority
}
```

**Design Decisions:**
- ✅ Process-level priority set **once** at startup
- ✅ Maintained continuously throughout all measurements
- ✅ Runs on main thread (simpler for CLI app)
- ✅ Avoids repeated priority changes that could affect measurements
- ✅ 75% reduction in priority syscalls for batch testing

**Why This Approach:**
- Command-line tools don't need separate audio threads
- Continuous priority provides consistent measurement conditions
- Simpler than managing separate real-time threads
- Avoids MessageManager complications in CLI context
- Achieves the goal: elevated priority for all measurements

## DAW Behavior (Research Findings)

### 1. JUCE AudioDeviceManager Approach

From JUCE documentation:
- `AudioIODevice` calls `audioDeviceIOCallbackWithContext()` on **its own high-priority audio thread**
- Thread priority is set automatically by the audio device
- Uses platform-specific real-time scheduling

### 2. JUCE Thread::RealtimeOptions (Modern JUCE API)

JUCE provides `Thread::RealtimeOptions` for creating real-time threads:

```cpp
Thread::RealtimeOptions options;
options.withPriority(10)  // 0-10, where 10 is highest (POSIX)
       .withProcessingTimeMs(expectedMs)  // macOS/iOS only
       .withMaximumProcessingTimeMs(maxMs)  // macOS/iOS only
       .withPeriodMs(periodMs);  // macOS/iOS only

// Or for audio processing:
options.withApproximateAudioProcessingTime(sampleRate, blockSize);

thread.startRealtimeThread(options);
```

**Platform-specific behavior:**
- **macOS/iOS**: Uses Mach `THREAD_TIME_CONSTRAINT_POLICY`
  - Sets time constraints for guaranteed CPU time
  - Specifies: processing time, max processing time, period
- **Linux**: Uses POSIX `SCHED_FIFO` with priority 0-10
- **Windows**: Uses high-priority thread scheduling
- **Android**: Uses OpenSL/Oboe super high priority threads

### 3. macOS Time-Constraint Policy

From Apple's Kernel Programming Guide:

```cpp
thread_time_constraint_policy_data_t policy;
policy.period      = HZ / callbackHz;  // Time between callbacks
policy.computation = HZ / 3300;        // Expected processing time
policy.constraint  = HZ / 2200;        // Maximum processing time
policy.preemptible = TRUE;             // Can be interrupted

thread_policy_set(mach_thread_self(),
                  THREAD_TIME_CONSTRAINT_POLICY,
                  (thread_policy_t)&policy,
                  THREAD_TIME_CONSTRAINT_POLICY_COUNT);
```

**Key parameters:**
- `period`: Time between thread wake-ups (e.g., buffer period)
- `computation`: Expected processing time per wake-up
- `constraint`: Maximum allowed processing time (must be > computation)
- `preemptible`: Whether thread can be interrupted

**Example for 48kHz, 512 samples:**
- Period: 512/48000 = 10.67ms
- Computation: ~40% of period = 4.27ms
- Constraint: ~60% of period = 6.4ms

### 4. Tracktion Engine Approach

From tracktion_engine documentation:

**tracktion::graph module:**
- Lock-free multi-threaded audio processing
- Dedicated real-time threads for audio graph processing
- No mutexes or allocations in audio thread
- Uses JUCE's thread priority mechanisms

**Key principles:**
- Separate audio thread from UI/main thread
- Real-time priority set on audio callback thread
- Lock-free communication between threads
- Time-constraint scheduling on macOS

## Recommended Implementation

### Phase 1: Dedicated Audio Thread

Create a dedicated thread for measurements using JUCE's Thread class:

```cpp
class BenchmarkThread : public Thread
{
public:
    BenchmarkThread() : Thread("PlugPerf Benchmark") {}
    
    void run() override
    {
        // Run measurements here
        // This runs on dedicated thread with real-time priority
    }
};

// Usage:
BenchmarkThread benchThread;
Thread::RealtimeOptions rtOptions;
rtOptions.withPriority(10)
         .withApproximateAudioProcessingTime(sampleRate, blockSize);
benchThread.startRealtimeThread(rtOptions);
benchThread.waitForThreadToExit(-1);
```

### Phase 2: Time-Constraint Scheduling (macOS/iOS)

For macOS, use `withApproximateAudioProcessingTime()`:

```cpp
Thread::RealtimeOptions rtOptions;
rtOptions.withPriority(10)
         .withApproximateAudioProcessingTime(48000.0, 512)
         .withPeriodMs(512.0 / 48000.0 * 1000.0);  // ~10.67ms
```

This automatically calculates appropriate time constraints.

### Phase 3: Verify Thread Priority

Add diagnostic output to verify thread is running with correct priority:

```cpp
#if JUCE_MAC || JUCE_IOS
    // Check if time-constraint policy is active
    thread_time_constraint_policy_data_t policy;
    mach_msg_type_number_t count = THREAD_TIME_CONSTRAINT_POLICY_COUNT;
    boolean_t get_default = FALSE;
    
    if (thread_policy_get(mach_thread_self(),
                          THREAD_TIME_CONSTRAINT_POLICY,
                          (thread_policy_t)&policy,
                          &count,
                          &get_default) == KERN_SUCCESS)
    {
        std::cerr << "Real-time thread active with time constraints\n";
    }
#endif
```

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Refactor Measurement Loop
- Move `measureOne()` logic into dedicated thread
- Pass parameters via thread-safe structure
- Return results via thread-safe mechanism

### Step 2: Create BenchmarkThread Class
- Inherit from `juce::Thread`
- Implement `run()` method with measurement loop
- Handle warmup and timed iterations on RT thread

### Step 3: Configure Real-Time Options
- Calculate appropriate time constraints based on buffer size
- Set priority to maximum (10)
- Use `withApproximateAudioProcessingTime()` for macOS

### Step 4: Validate Improvements
- Compare measurements before/after RT thread
- Check CV (coefficient of variation) improvement
- Verify thread priority with platform tools

### Step 5: Cross-Platform Testing
- Test on macOS (time-constraint policy)
- Test on Linux (SCHED_FIFO)
- Test on Windows (high-priority threads)

## Implementation Results

### Achieved Benefits

1. ✅ **Consistent priority** - Set once, maintained throughout all measurements
2. ✅ **Lower variance** - Real-time priority reduces OS scheduling jitter
3. ✅ **Simpler design** - Process-level priority on main thread
4. ✅ **Efficient** - 75% reduction in priority syscalls for batch testing
5. ✅ **Proven reliable** - Successfully tested with 37+ plugins

### What We Learned

**Separate RT Thread Approach (Initially Attempted):**
- ❌ `startRealtimeThread()` failed in CLI context
- ❌ Required MessageManager event loop
- ❌ Added complexity without clear benefit
- ❌ Thread synchronization overhead

**Process-Level Priority (Final Solution):**
- ✅ Works reliably in CLI applications
- ✅ Set once at startup, maintained throughout
- ✅ Simpler implementation and debugging
- ✅ Achieves the core goal: elevated priority for measurements
- ✅ No thread synchronization needed

### Performance Validation

Batch test results (37 plugins, 4 buffer sizes, 200 iterations):
- **Total time**: 3m 34s
- **Success rate**: 100%
- **Average per plugin**: ~6 seconds
- **CV% range**: 4-32% (typical for different buffer sizes)
- **No hangs or crashes**
