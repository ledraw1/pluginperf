# PlugPerf Project Backlog

## Project Summary
PlugPerf is a performance benchmarking and optimization tool tailored for audio plugins, with an initial focus on JUCE and VST3 plugin formats. The goal is to identify performance bottlenecks, validate improvements, and provide actionable insights to plugin developers for creating more efficient and responsive audio software.

## Notes and Future Considerations

- **Validation**: Establish rigorous validation procedures to ensure benchmarking accuracy across different hardware configurations.
- **Platform Support**: Prioritize stable support on major OS platforms before expanding to niche environments.
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Monitor emerging plugin standards and update PlugPerf accordingly.
- **Performance Metrics**: Explore additional metrics such as power consumption and thread concurrency.
- **Community Engagement**: Develop forums or channels for user feedback, bug reports, and feature requests.
- **Security**: Ensure safe execution of third-party plugins to prevent crashes or security vulnerabilities during benchmarking.
